## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Discord Bot Token
- Tesseract OCR installed

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
4. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Discord Bot Setup

1. Create a Discord application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a bot and copy the token
3. Enable the following bot permissions:
   - Send Messages
   - Use Slash Commands
   - Manage Roles
   - Read Message History
   - Attach Files
4. Invite the bot to your server with proper permissions

## How It Works

1. **User Request**: User runs `/requestrole` and selects a department
2. **Image Upload**: User uploads a screenshot proving department membership
3. **OCR Analysis**: Bot analyzes the image using Tesseract OCR
4. **Verification**: Bot searches for department keywords in extracted text
5. **Role Assignment**: If verified, role is automatically assigned
6. **Manual Review**: If not auto-verified, request goes to admin queue

## Configuration

- Modify `allowed_roles` list to add/remove supported departments
- Use `/setadminrole` to configure which role can use admin commands
- Requests are stored in `requests.json` for persistence

## Health Monitoring

The bot includes a Flask server for uptime monitoring:
- Health endpoint: `http://your-bot-url/health`
- Status endpoint: `http://your-bot-url/`
